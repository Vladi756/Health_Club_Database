# LSBU_Health_Club_Database

A database modeled, implemented, and queried as part of a coursework for my Big Data & Database Systems modules at university. Mock data was inserted which was thoroughly analyzed and visualized.

## Modelling 

The initial ER model was based on a document outlining user requirements. It was done in Visual Paradigm:

It is a comprehensive model normalized to the 3rd normal form. 

## Implementation

The tables were created using SQL in Microsofts SQL Server. The detailed SQL create statements and queries can be seen in the uploaded files. Here is a sample:

## Querying 

The database was queried using queries, triggers and stored procedures. Here is a sample of a query which returns the personal trainers available for bookings this week:

## Visualization 

The SQL server was connected to Tableau and a comprehensive dasbhoard was created based off the data inserted into the database:

The dashboard tells a story of the business and helps management make data driven decisions.
